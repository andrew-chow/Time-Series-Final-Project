# Forecasting Retail Sales of US Clothing and Clothing Accessory Stores

## Abstract
The dataset to be analysed and discussed within this paper is the monthly sales (in millions of dollars) of
clothing and clothing accessory stores from 1992 to 2019. Using this data set, our goal is to forecast the sales
of clothing and clothing accessory stores 12 months into the future using seasonal autoregressive integrated
moving average (SARIMA) models and Box-Jenkings methodology. Forecasting these values will help us
gain insight into the fluctuations of the clothing and clothing accessory storesâ€™ sales due to inflation and also
seasonal changes.
